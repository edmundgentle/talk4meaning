<p lang="en-GB">In my early teens I spent a lot of time poring over photos like these and fantasizing. The main part of the fantasy was that I was an outstanding singer and guitarist who was onstage mesmerizing thousands of festival- goers. Each member of the crowd would be utterly enraptured by my stage presence. After the show I would be mobbed by fans, who would all buy my records as soon as they got home. <a href="/2013/09/all-right-now-engaging-groups-of-children-at-storytime-and-in-assembly-with-help-from-free-queen-and-the-wiggles/#more-754" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading All Right Now!

<p lang="en-GB">It’s official, this means nothing. For years people like me have been trying to work out what Dylan meant by lyrics like these. For years he has ignored everybody, and left us desperately trying to make sense of what he meant. Now Dylan has admitted that this song was a random collection of snatches of conversation overheard in bars and coffee houses. Maybe it’s sad, but we used to have great fun trying to learn the lyrics off by heart, even though we never had access to the printed words. It meant nothing to us then, apart from the certain knowledge that Dylan in this era of his life was effortlessly cool. Some of his lyrics just hit you as being totally meaningful: <a href="/2013/07/the-pump-dont-work-cause-the-vandals-took-the-handles-learning-to-talk-and-being-autistic-desperately-making-sense-of-nonsense-with-help-from-bob-dylan-and-soluna-samay/#more-738" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading The pump don’t work ‘cause the vandals took the handles.

<p lang="en-GB">Sometimes I can sit in a room full of people and feel as if I am the loneliest person in the world. Actually that’s a load of melodramatic tosh: I live in France and am surrounded by French people who speak no English. As my French is rudimentary, I have to stick to very basic subjects, or sit quietly and listen in to the conversations going on around me. I have to work hard to be included: by leaning forward to listen in, make eye contact with the person talking, and smile or frown (if I can get the gist of what is being said).</p>
<p lang="en-GB">However I sometimes long to be able to talk about subjects that are important to me; like the latest episode of <i>Community</i>. I want to share with my neighbours why this cult US comedy series set in, Greendale Community College, is so funny. It’s partly the characters, including Abed, the teenager with Asperger’s who seems to know more about human behaviour and communication than the so called ‘normal’ members of his study group. But my favourite is Britta, the ex-anarchist international campaigner, foot model and waitress. She desperately wants to ‘connect’ with other women, but doesn’t know how. Jeff Winger, the cool and aloof heartthrob ex-lawyer, gives her some advice: “Women love to <i>group</i>, so spend time in the ladies’ room making small talk while fixing your makeup.”</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Britta heads off to the bathroom and meets self-confessed gossip addict Shirley. Shirley starts to tell Britta about her latest makeup party she plans to host with her mom. This gives Britta the heads up to launch into a tirade against international cosmetics companies who are denuding the rainforests and exploiting the women of remote tribes in the Matto Grosso. Shirley switches on the hand dryer and leaves, while Britta keeps on talking. It’s comedy brilliance with a social message (at least that’s how I justify watching it). Britta is not able to make a connection with her peers because she is always engaging in <i>big talk</i>, without being able to have fun chatting about small subjects.</p>

<p lang="en-GB">This reminds me of myself when I left my all-boys’ school and started attending a local college to do my A Levels. I was very keen to connect with girls, but was a bit lacking in experience. Just before I left school, I spent a weekend with my brother, who was at university. I looked around at what the cool guys were doing. Many of them wore duffle coats, and had paperbacks sticking out of their pockets. These were carefully turned round so that you could read the author and title. I guessed the idea was that a <i>chick</i> would notice that you were reading Carlos Castaneda, or Hermann Hesse, or even Thomas Mann, and start talking to you about your cool choice of literature.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">As soon as I left school I bought a duffle coat and copies of Lord of the Rings and War and Peace. I was going to attract some really literate chicks and spend hours talking about my favourite authors. Bad mistake: duffle coat pockets are designed only to take paperbacks of 200 pages or less.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">So each day I tried a different book from my mum’s bookshelves: Death in Venice… Death in the Cathedral… Death of a Salesman… even Death on the Nile. Nothing. Not even a condescending look. What was going on?</p>
<p lang="en-GB">A girl in our English Literature class was extremely quiet. Actually she was completely silent. Every morning, on my way to college, she would get on my train, and if we were sitting opposite each other (which I always tried to engineer) she would avoid eye contact with me. If our eyes did chance to meet, then she would blush and pointedly look away. I must admit, I found her silence quite fascinating. Why didn’t she speak? When she did talk, what would it be about? Would she give me her phone number? We were sitting opposite each other one day on our way back from college, when there was a big jolt, and the train came to a sudden halt. It was in the days before in-train announcements, so no one knew how long we would be stuck waiting. After 10 minutes of embarrassed silence, Penny (for that was the silent angel’s name) suddenly spoke: “You must be a very fast reader.”</p>
<p lang="en-GB">I was a bit stunned. I went red and avoided eye contact. “You see, every day you have a different paperback in your pocket. Finally you have chosen one that I like. Do you like <i>Women in Love</i>? Do you think Lawrence is making a statement about war and inherent masculine aggression in the scene where the two men wrestle in front of the roaring log fire? And do you agree that Lawrence uses the character of Rupert Birkin to expound his ideas, including on gender?” I had to admit, because Penny clearly had me sussed and was enjoying teasing me, that I had only read the blurb on the back of the book, and by the time we reached the station I had confessed that I was no match for Penny on the literary front and was only using the books as a ‘babe magnet’. My game was up, but the genie was also out of her bottle. Not only did I get her phone number, but <i>she </i>asked <i>me</i> to go with her to see the Ken Russell film of Women in Love. Which was a bit of an eye-opener, I can tell you.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">I got to know Penny quite well. A lot of people thought that, like Britta, she was aloof and stuck-up. But I think that she was just very very shy, and not able to engage people in <i>small talk </i>and <i>chat</i>. She much preferred to have <i>discussions</i> on topics about which she had some in-depth knowledge. Then she could <i>ask questions</i>, <i>give answers</i>, <i>expand ideas</i> and make connections with other like-minded people. Unfortunately, try as I might, I could not get excited about the life and works of David Herbert Lawrence, and Penny felt equally cold about Tolstoy and Tolkien. She went on to gain a chair at a red brick university, while I am sitting on a chair in France writing a blog about her.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Where is this all leading? Well I think that many children, teenagers and adults who are very quiet, and unhappy about being so, need support to understand the different types of <i>verbal interaction</i> that we humans sometimes engage in. And the adults and peers who want to help them need to be clear too. Here are some definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB"><b>Small Talk</b>: the small comments we make to complete strangers, to fill a silence: e.g. at the bus stop, saying, ‘Looks like the sun is trying to come out.’ Apparently not everyone engages in this type of talk (I have been told that Germans don’t do small talk.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB"><b>Chat</b>: talking briefly about neutral topics, like the weather, shopping, last night’s TV. No important information is passed on. We are just talking for the pleasure it gives us (we hope).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB"><b>Banter</b>: what mainly men and teenage boys who know each other well do, to connect with each other. It’s usually good-humoured and has a lot of sarcasm involved; e.g. “I see Spurs did the usual last night” (i.e. drew 1-1 with Wigan, even though they beat Man Utd 2-1 on Saturday). To which the other man responds, “Yeh, whatever.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB"><b>Conversation</b>: where two or more people share ideas about a topic of shared knowledge that is important (e.g. teenage girls talking about boys and shoes. I’m not being sexist: these are popular topics.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB"><b>Discussion</b>: where two or more people share ideas in-depth about topics that are really important to all concerned; e.g. why the Fat Controller locked Thomas and the other striking engines in their sheds, and brought in a load of blackleg rolling stock from another company, until those involved in legitimate industrial action were forced back to work . (I kid you not; I had this conversation with a six-year old once.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">I often think of conversation as being like dancing: some people do it naturally without thinking, while others can do well with experience. Some, who develop quite significant anxiety, will need a lot of coaching and will develop their confidence if shown the right steps by a sympathetic partner: preferably one who is more interested in dancing with you than the small injuries that you inflict as you tread on her toes.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">It’s very important for adults to know about the different types of interaction that are possible, and to be able to work out, when you are getting to know someone, what mode you are in, and what is appropriate. At a bus stop in Northern Ireland, for example, it is very likely that a stranger will say to you, “How are you?” That’s the local way of saying <i>hello</i>, and possibly an invitation to engage in small talk. I wish I had known this when a man covered in tattoos on a railway platform made eye contact with me and felt inclined to ask me how I was doing. I explained that I was feeling a bit <i>bloated</i> because I had been eating far too much bread recently, and I had just drunk some fizzy water which was making me feel a bit <i>gassy</i>. Fair play to him, he could tell I was out of my depth, as his next question was, “I take it you&#8217;re from England?” He&#8217;d met my type before, and he kindly steered me towards <i>small talk</i> about the weather. As we sat opposite each other on the train, we struck up a <i>conversation</i> about children, and I was able to give him some guidance about his wee boy of three who had just developed a stammer.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">We will probably all know adults who are on either end of the interaction spectrum: those who only talk when they feel that they have something to say, and feel most comfortable when they are giving you a lecture, as compared to people who constantly engage in small talk, with lengthy bits of chat thrown in. I have met children who are judged to be extremely quiet, who are able to talk to an adult at length about a subject they know a lot about. It’s just that their specialist subject may not be part of the curriculum, or they might be worried that you might not be interested.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Britta and Penny were most comfortable with <i>discussion</i>, but it may have been helpful to support them to identify other types of communication, and to encourage them when they have a go at small talk and chat. Likewise with children who feel very uncomfortable about talking in groups: we can find out what their specialist subjects are, and find ways of including these in talk. So if a boy or girl from a farming family, for example, has a fascination with farm vehicles, we can find books on the subject and share these with them, and plan to include other children in the conversation/discussion and play. It can be helpful for teenagers who are finding it difficult to relate to their peers to learn about the value of small talk, chat and conversation.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Some people never make it down to the level of small talk and chat, but I live in hope that my French improves enough so that I can get to the lofty height of conversation!</p>

<p lang="en-GB">I have taken part in some bizarre experiences in schools in my time, but by far the weirdest was a ‘bonding session’ at a primary school I was involved with in the late 1980’s. A new head teacher had been appointed, and on the first day of the autumn term he decided that we should all take part in a ‘getting to know each other day’. Looking back on it, this guy was a bit ‘left field’. We later found out that he had spent the summer involved in an ‘Iron John’ experience in California, which included spending time in a sweat lodge and banging tom toms in the wilderness with a load of like-minded menfolk. The first activity of the day was called ‘Give yourself a new name: start a new life’. The idea was that you choose a creature or natural object that reflects your personality, and then name yourself after it, as was traditional among Native Americans. I thought that <i>Raging Bull</i> sounded great, but was maybe a bit too aggressive for a primary school. <i>Wild Stallion </i>was out (not a good image). Likewise <i>Lone Pine </i>(a bit aloof and not a team player). The teacher next to me was a bit of a wag, and decided to help me. “Mike, you’re very quiet most of the time, but in meetings sometimes you put your head above the parapet and say something outrageous. Then you go back inside your shell and spend the rest of the week worrying and apologising to people. You could call yourself <i>Turtle’s Head</i>.” So I did, and it stuck. I didn’t realise until a decade later, when I saw the second Austin Powers film, why everyone thought my new name was so funny, (if you don’t already know, you can find out for yourself on <i>Urban Dictionary, </i>but be prepared to be disgusted!) <a href="/2013/07/supporting-childrens-behaviour-development-making-behavioural-mistakes-and-good-choices-part-1-with-help-from-the-rolling-stones-and-rob-long/#more-722" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Supporting children’s behaviour development.

<p lang="en-GB">I’m part of a lost generation. I was too young to be a hippy and too old to be a punk. I turned 13 in 1970 and stood on the platform at Guildford railway station watching trainload after trainload of hippies heading to the Isle of Wight festival. There they would see countless legends such as Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, The Who and Joni Mitchell. Being a hippie seemed to make perfect sense to me, and I wanted to be like them. All you needed to do was grow sideburns, wear a tie die t-shirt and sit on the grass, singing <i>Woodstock</i> by Joni Mitchell, listen to Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young on your portable cassette recorder , while talking about changing the world, though not actually doing anything about it. I turned 16 in 1973 and just about had sideburns. I sneaked out of school and watched <i>Woodstock</i> at the local cinema. After that being a hippie made even more sense: you needed to wear very bright clothes, have a <i>chick</i>, and say ‘far out man‘ a lot. Rock and roll was still important, as was looking cool. I turned 17 in 1974, and saw Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young at Wembley Stadium. They sang <i>Woodstock</i> with Joni Mitchell. But there was a change in the air: Joni wore a smart white suit and sang jazzy, discordant songs with Tom Scott and the LA Express. The Band did a set, but they were boring. Practically every musician onstage that day was over 30, but they really could sing and play (apart from Neil Young, who was very drunk.) <a href="/2013/06/young-gifted-and-stuck-part-2-or-helping-children-with-ongoing-spelling-problems-assisted-by-crosby-stills-nash-and-young-joni-mitchell-and-blondie/#more-699" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Young, Gifted… and Stuck (Part 2): or helping children with ongoing spelling problems, assisted by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Joni Mitchell and Blondie!">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

<p lang="en-GB">I don’t mind admitting that when I was 14 I was big fan of Ozzie Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Bill Ward and Geezer Butler, aka Black Sabbath. Their image, music and lyrics seemed to have been designed to appeal to the spotty adolescent male. Very little seems to have changed since they first emerged from the UK’s industrial heartland in the early 1970s. Recent concert footage shows that they still appeal to 14 year old boys, as well as the ‘inner 14 year old’ of men in their fifties. I moved on from Sabbath when Ozzie ate a live bat on stage, (legend has it that someone threw an unconscious bat on stage. Ozzie thought it was rubber so bit its head off). After that I took to listening to more ‘progressive’ bands like Yes and King Crimson. Though I’m clear that Sabbath and their ilk were a passing phase for me, I’m still very confused about gender. I’m not talking about my lingering fondness for the music of Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane phases, but about what to think about boys and girls learning. <a href="/2013/05/help-me-with-my-mind-or-keeping-the-differences-between-boys-and-girls-in-proportion-with-help-from-ozzie-osbourne-and-black-sabbath/#more-659" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading &#8220;Help me with my mind!&#8221; Or keeping the differences between boys and girls in perspective, with help from Ozzie Osbourne and Black Sabbath">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

<p lang="en-GB">The word <i>wonder</i> has several meanings. School assemblies are supposed to fill children with a sense of ‘awe and wonder’. Children should leave an outstanding assembly feeling thrilled and with a sense of the greatness of the world and the power of the spiritual life. As a teacher I would strive to achieve this state in the massed ranks of children, but they often left my assemblies on a Monday morning wondering what it had all been about. So in that sense, the word <i>wonder </i>involves thinking about confusion. <a href="/2013/05/shes-buying-a-stairway-to-heaven-or-how-to-help-children-wonder-with-help-from-led-zeppelin/#more-622" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading She’s buying a stairway to heaven: or how to help children wonder, with help from Led Zeppelin">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>
