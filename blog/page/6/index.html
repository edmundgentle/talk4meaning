I like them in ‘a waiting for the train, watching it pull into the platform and seeing the people getting out, finally getting on myself, stowing the luggage safely, taking out the new Robert Harris novel I’ve just bought in WH Smith (buy one, get one half price), watching the suburbs gradually pass by (noting how even the smartest people wantonly chuck rubbish over their back garden fence onto the railway embankment), observing the rolling hills flash by, and finally dozing off and dribbling out of a corner of my mouth, with the sound of incomprehensible messages from the driver about apologies for delays and reminding passengers of the wide selection of outrageously-priced sandwiches in the buffet car drifting into my subconscious’ kind of way.</span></p>

		<p lang="en-GB">Heaven. Heaven is a place.<br />
A place where nothing, nothing ever happens.</p>
<p lang="en-GB"><i>Heaven</i> by Talking Heads</p>
<p lang="en-GB"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/11.jpg" alt="1" width="306" height="165" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/11.jpg 306w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/01/11-300x161.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" /></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Life was quite hectic when my children were very little. Sometimes I felt so tired that I would have a waking dream about being in an airliner on a long haul flight, with nothing to do but gaze out of the window and be waited on by air hostesses while listening to <i>Heaven</i> by Talking Heads. Then I would come to my senses and realise that it was my turn to load the shopping onto the conveyor belt at the checkout. In my dream I’d always reserved my seat well in advance, so I wouldn’t get stuck by the aisle and have to move every time my neighbours wanted to go to the toilet. I read in an article once that men pass wind about 15 times per day; though more often, and more unpleasantly, if they eat a lot of sulphur-rich foods like beans, cabbage, cheese, soda and eggs. (We have Gillian McKeith to thank for her revelation that ‘food combining’; e.g. eating dairy, meat, pulses and citrus foods during the same meal, can lead to ‘gas’.) The article didn’t mention females and gas, so to complete my vision of heaven there would be a woman sitting in the seat next to me. <a href="/2014/01/finding-heaven-at-38000-feet-or-bringing-up-twins-with-help-from-talking-heads-lynryrd-skynyrd-and-a-roll-of-masking-tape/#more-926" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Finding Heaven at 38,000 feet.

<p lang="en-GB">Sheep have played a part in rural life for centuries, and have found their way into mythology, legends, literature and stories for children. Think <i>Jason and the Golden Fleece</i>, <i>Far From the Madding Crowd</i> by Thomas Hardy, <i>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</i> and even <i>Shaun the Sheep</i>. Transhumance, the seasonal migration of people with their flocks of sheep or herds of cattle in search of fresh pasture, is the stuff of legend, as well as being a big feature in American Westerns. Let’s take <i>Dances With Wolves </i>as an example<i>.</i> Kevin Costner took a huge risk when he bought the rights for this film, then produced, directed and starred in it. In 1990 there hadn’t been a hit movie based on life in the 19<sup>th</sup> century American West for quite some time. It was his directorial debut, and much of the film’s dialogue was to be in the Sioux <i>Lakota</i> language, with English subtitles. Add 6,000 rampaging buffalo (including two tame ones belonging to Neil Young), vast outdoor locations with untrained wolves, and you have a potential turkey on your hands. Kevin pulled it off though, and the film was a massive success. <a href="/2014/01/dances-with-sheep-or-childrens-role-play-in-the-digital-age-with-help-from-ray-charles-kevin-costner-and-ghita-the-digital-shepherd/#more-918" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Dances with Sheep: or children’s role play in the digital age.

<p lang="en-GB">Most people from the UK didn’t travel abroad much in the early 1970s. It’s not like we stayed in our villages and only went into the town across the valley on market days (that was in the 1670s), but there wasn’t the opportunity to go on holidays to the other side of the world. Your family might spend a week in southern Spain or Majorca, but anything else was considered to be highly exotic. Certain of us hankered after taking the ferry from Harwich to the Hook of Holland. Naturally this was to see the Anne Frank Museum, the canals, and the galleries containing masterpieces by Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Vermeer and the like. Obviously after all that you’d be a bit tired and would need to get refreshment from one of the legendary coffee shops, causing you to spend the rest of the day admiring the lovely colours of all the tulips, and marvelling at how slowly the sails on the windmills turned. <a href="/2014/01/yoi-dudu-doi-dudu-doi-dudu-doi-dudu-om-bom-ba-or-how-children-develop-speech-sounds-with-help-from-focus-golden-earring-and-1000-drummers-in-rotterdam/#more-897" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Double Dutch?

<p lang="en-GB">It was 1969. The streets and universities of Paris and the US were in the grip of serious student unrest. <i>Honky Tonk Women </i>by The Rolling Stones was at number one in the charts, and I was ending my second year of a seven year stretch of incarceration as a ‘prisoner of conscience’. Two years previously my parents had examined their consciences (and bank balance) and decided that I should attend a boys’ boarding school five hundred miles north of the family home. It was often tough going, but the experience had a major part in making me what I am, so I’m not complaining. <a href="/2013/12/get-on-my-cloud-or-how-not-to-develop-confident-speaking-with-help-from-mick-jagger-rhys-ifans-and-the-cast-of-the-boat-that-rocked/#more-884" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Get On My Cloud!

<p lang="en-GB">When we hear about children teasing or being unkind to each other, we are often told, ‘Children can be so cruel.’ I don’t actually believe that. I think that when children tease each other they are either making a mistake that they can learn from, or copying adults around them. Take the example of stammering/stuttering (they mean the same thing, which is accurately termed as <i>dysfluency</i>.) Everyone is dysfluent at some time or other in our lives: often when we are tired, highly nervous, or have had too much alcohol! Many children between ages two and four go through a period of <i>normal non-fluency</i>, where they seem to have so many ideas and not enough words to express them all. This can be a natural part of our lives as communicators, or become a serious problem. Which way it goes will depend on how other people react to the way we speak. <a href="/2013/11/bwi-ba-ba-ba-ba-do-or-why-children-are-not-so-cruel-supporting-children-who-stammer-with-help-from-musharaf-asghar-gareth-gates-and-john-scatman-larkin/#more-864" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Bwi ba ba ba ba do: or why children are not ‘so cruel’.

		<p lang="en-GB">Did you ever wake up with them bullfrogs on your mind?</p>
<p lang="en-GB"><i>Bullfrog Blues </i>by Canned Heat (often performed as an encore by Rory Gallagher).</p>
<p lang="en-GB"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-844" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Guinea-pig-photo.jpg" alt="" width="270" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Guinea-pig-photo.jpg 356w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Guinea-pig-photo-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Guinea-pig-photo-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" />I’ve never woken up thinking about bullfrogs, but I do spend time thinking about some of the experiences I have had teaching other people’s children over the past 30 or so years. Teaching is a very demanding job, but of all the jobs in the whole world it’s probably the one where you can have most influence on children’s lives. And having 30 children thrust together for five days a week, as they grow and try out new things, can sometimes lead to a particular kind of heady intensity developing between them. Teachers know this and develop strategies for helping children get on together. However there are some things that you just can’t bargain for. <a href="/2013/11/did-you-ever-wake-up-with-them-bullfrogs-on-your-mind/#more-843" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Did you ever wake up with them bullfrogs on your mind?
