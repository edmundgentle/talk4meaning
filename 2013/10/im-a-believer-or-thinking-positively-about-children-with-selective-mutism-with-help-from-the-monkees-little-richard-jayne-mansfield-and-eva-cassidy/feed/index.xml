					<description><![CDATA[Hello Cyndi
Thank you for contacting me. I&#039;m sure that a child with a &#039;primary&#039; disability could also have selective mutism. However, autism is a disability where anxiety about talking is one of the main difficulties. I always avoid describing a child with autism as having SM. There is a practical reason for doing this. These days many teachers and professionals feel confident that they understand ASD and can relax and apply approaches that are helpful. However, as soon as you suggest a child with ASD had mutism, everybody panics and tries to seek specialists in that filed.

Having said that, I recommend the book I wrote with Maggie Johnson, called &#039;Supporting Quiet Children&#039;. Not because I wrote it, but because it is written specifically as a first port of call for teachers like yourself who want to explore why children are quiet. It has 40 practical ideas that you can use straight away.
 hope that is helpful, and please email me on talk4meaning@gmail.com if you want to continue the conversation.
Good luck!
Michael]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m currently working with a 6 year old student who is on the Autism Spectrum.  His aptitude, receptive, and expressive language skills are all within the 50&#039;s range.  He is essentially mute at school but speaks at home (as documented on video).  I suspect Selective Mutism coexists with Autism.  It is difficult to locate a psychologist who would be trained in treating a child with these complications.  Any suggestions on treatment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Clare
I think that teachers are more aware of SM, however silent children are still seen as being &#039;controlling and manipulative&#039; which is the exact opposite of how they are. Their desire to please adults leaves them frozen in the fear that they will make a &#039;mistake&#039; by saying or doing the &#039;wrong&#039; thing.

I hope you are doing OK now
Very best wishes
Michael 
PS many of my posts are written to increase awareness of how best to help quiet children.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love your blog.  Having experienced SM for around 10 years (possibly longer) during my childhood, it is good to know this is something people now talk about (or not!!)  It wasn&#039;t something anyone had heard of when I was growing up and, like Molly, I had some very negative responses from adults.  In fact, I only discovered the name for it a few years ago when introduced to a child with SM.  Great work!  Hope it leads to some understanding.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As always rivetting funny and substantial. Simple question: I have a boy who is a selective mute in my (SLD)year 11 class. Currently recording short responses on various voice recorders and playing them back to us.
Fluent at home. The SALT has just told me he has a diagnosos of ASC and that makes him not a selective mute.
Intuitively I&#039;m saying he&#039;s someone who may or may not feature on the ASC spectrum AND  currently a selective mute.
All label talk I know but am I right? You can be someone with autism AND be a selective mute?
