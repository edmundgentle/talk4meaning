					<description><![CDATA[Hi Cat! Thank you for your kind words. In my experience, fans of the Smiths are always very interesting people. Have you seen 500 Days of Summer? The two main characters are Smiths fans.
I write the posts to help people think about children and helping children to express themselves, and to have a bit of fun writing.
I have another site 1970s Mind 21st Century Body, that is a bit more &#039;adult&#039;. I hope it rains today, so you can have fun making your mix tape!!!
Thanks again

					<description><![CDATA[I just stumbled across your post when looking for some lyrics for the smiths song ask.  I didn&#039;t know the name of it, now I do.  What a beautifully written piece, thanks for this.  I too interrupt when others are talking as my mind can be racing and I get excited, thanks for reminding me to think about becoming a better conversationalist and how much I love music,  if it rains tomorrow i am going to make a &#039;mix tape&#039; with my husband and dance with my young kids :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow Cathy! What did you sing? Something upbeat like &#039;Girlfriend in a Coma&#039; or &#039;This Charming Man&#039;? And did he like you to flail your arms around while whirling a large bunch of flowers? 
Only joking... I wonder if they were responding to something that gave you a lot of pleasure, and that they associated with you being happy and having fun?
There certainly is something about the Smiths and Morrissey that attracts millions of people the world over. I was in Bangkok recently and played &#039;Ask&#039; before I started giving my talk about quiet children. One of the delegates nearly jumped out of her seat with pleasure!
Best wishes from Michael]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the Smiths!!
When  my children were very young ( my eldest especially) would not go off to sleep to any nursery rhymes or lullablies, but... sing a smiths song or put them on the record player (yes the record player!!) and he used to drop off really quickly!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow Laurie, that must have been amazing! With hindsight, I think I would have enjoyed those gigs. I was 30 in 1987, so maybe I was a bit old?
Next week&#039;s post is about children and colour, with more help from Joni and an artist called Liz West. I am flying to Bangkok tomorrow to run some training courses, so hope to have some very colourful photos for the post!
Thank you for replying

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael, I would have been happy to talk to you about the Smiths, one of my favourite bands - I was converted to them after seeing them on TOTP in 1985. My big sister and I went to see them live 3 times including their last gig together in 1987 at Brixton Academy when I was 16 ;-)]]></description>
