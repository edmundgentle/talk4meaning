					<description><![CDATA[Not to mention poor Paul Kossoff
I&#039;d rather Reynard than Lord Renyard (Lib Dem)bearing in mind that Brighton hosts party conferences.

Yes Melatonin appears to be one route that works for some  people with autism and sleep disorders. But it is, I agree, a massive problem. Also anecdotally another significant distractor is the very high incidence of serious constipation. Forget the so called scientific links with stomach complaints and MMR  and stuff and just think how constipation is going to make you feel, especially in concert with serious sensory modulation issues. Probably not like communicating with others.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Foxes on the roof!!! OMG!! WTF!! (What the fox?)
It&#039;s a good job that hunting with dogs has been abolished, because  you could have a pack of hounds a over your roof, or even an entire hunt camped out on the garden waiting for Reynard to come down!

The next blog is about children with sleep problems, which includes 80% of the autistic population.
Dr Trevor Stevens, whose work will feature in the post, was dangerously close to being in Fleetwood Mac in the period just prior to Albatross. He became a session musician instead and played with this likes of Paul Kossoff. 
Trevor is still alive, and is a behavioural psychologist and sleep specialist, so I guess he was lucky to have escaped thd curse of Fleetwood Mac. 
Best wishes

					<description><![CDATA[Straight off the bat... the Yvlis song is bonkers in a good way.
  
Katja, Fleetwood Mac had 3 guitarists because they always needed a reserve on board, as they kept losing them to drugs, stints as gravediggers and cults etc on a regular basis. The position of guitarist in Fleetwood Mac was, at one stage as insecure as being a member of the Pretenders.

Boring answer re Bowie, because he kept (pre heart attack) reinventing his persona in the realisation that pop culturati (i.e. us) have a short attention span.

The one and only thing I have in common with the late Mrs Thatcher is the need for very little sleep....However my short sleep was very rudely interupted one night recently....I know exactly how foxes sound, as they make said sound in my garden quite a lot  (in the middle of Brighton, I don&#039;t have country pile, as I said, just the one thing in common with Thatch) They also walk about a lot on my loft roof above my head at night.

Anyway if you want a really effective way to wake you up and out of your sleep I can reccomend sleeping with the loft window open and having a fox fall in through it in the middle of the night.It really is quite effective.Not in a good way.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Katja
You&#039;ll have to wait for the next blog before I can answer that question. Dr Trevor Stevens, who is a sleep specialist, musician and Behavioural Psychologist, has a personal experience of Fleetwood Mac in that era, and all will he revealed next week!
Sleep well!!

					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful blog, some great advice (albeit no use for me because I&#039;m asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow!).
But one question might keep me up tonight: Why DID they need three guitarists?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Trevor! I&#039;m sure you will recognise many of the ideas as the ones you discussed with me in relation to children with sleep issues.
You and your terrific CD will be fully referenced in the next post! (And you no doubt know why Fleetwood Mac needed three guitarists for Albatross!!)
Best wishes
