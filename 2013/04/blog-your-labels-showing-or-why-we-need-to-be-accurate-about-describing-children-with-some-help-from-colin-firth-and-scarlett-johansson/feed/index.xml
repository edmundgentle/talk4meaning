					<description><![CDATA[I have seasonal allergies, so I don&#039;t pin anything to a clothesline; I must accept the fact that my socks will get mixed up in my clothes dryer. Oh well...

I have been labeled as &quot;quiet&quot; both as a child and as an adult.  As a child, that label caused me to withdraw into myself even further.  My teachers expected me to be quiet -- so I was.  I was also overlooked by my teachers.  My needs were unmet because I never vocalized them and they never asked.

I have listened to children being labeled by their teachers as &quot;biters.&quot;  Is it any wonder that the frequency of the biting increases?  Teachers need to understand why children bite before they can implement strategies to prevent the biting from continuing.

Teachers also need to learn strategies for supporting children who choose not to speak in class.

Every child has a name and that name should be the only &quot;label&quot; that teachers apply to them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Elly!
I couldn&#039;t possibly comment! 
Seriously though, what do you think about the labels we attach to children?

					<description><![CDATA[Oh dear, I always peg out the socks in pairs, my husband doesn&#039;t. I think I&#039;m just normal and that he is totally disorganised. He does waste an awful lot of his time searching for things. And I waste an awful lot of my time searching for his things too. Who needs the label here?]]></description>
