					<description><![CDATA[Hi Elly!
I think the Stonehenge experience is interesting. 
I have been involved in 4 games of paintball, and found it totally invigorating, at the time, but very disturbing afterwards at how easily I could get involved in &#039;killing&#039; people. But it was only a game. Some men found the whole thing very disturbing. Some women loved it and others did not.
I think there are BROAD gender variations between males and females, that make sense biologically, but big differences among individuals from each sex. How our cultures react to those differences are important, and I think that this is where adult role models come in, as well as the influence of older boys and girls. As children grow into teenage, I think that film, TV, media and book role models become very important in both behaviour and values. 
In terms of language development, most girls are ahead of boys in early life, but boys can develop quickly if brought up in a culture where talk, and being articulate is valued. This reminds me of wales, with the strong oral tradition, as opposed to parts of London where I have lived and worked where men being highly articulate would not be seen as a valuable asset.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another very thoughtprovoking piece, Michael. I run round my woods playing &#039;the lost princess&#039; with my grandaughter (her favourite game) whilst the three grandsons run round with sticks that make gun noises. They have all been brought up to help with household chores, etc. I find that farming cuts across both genders easily. Once in a school I taught we built stonehenge replicas out of any material available and everyone got stuck in equally. Is that because it is a historic site and nobody has seen it being built?]]></description>
