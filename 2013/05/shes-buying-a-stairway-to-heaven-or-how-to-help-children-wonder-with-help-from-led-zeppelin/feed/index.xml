					<description><![CDATA[Hello Moriel
I think you are right there. I suppose it is all about creating atmosphere. When I was young I saw an illustrated copy of Goblin Market by Eleanor Farjeon. I didn&#039;t understand half of it, but I knew it was something incredibly creepy. I know that Stairway to Heaven is a bit mad, but it does create a kind of atmosphere. I used to listen to the Incredible String Band, who interestingly were a big influence on Led Zeppelin. Their lyrics were a lot of funny nonsense, bug quite fascinating all the same.
And who knows what half of Bob Dylan&#039;s songs are all about?!

What makes me laugh is the way that children try to make sense of the weird things that adults say.
Best wishes
Michael]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[sharing the journey - if I have learnt nothing else in the last few years this is something big. Being with children sharing their journey and learning ourselves at the same time. And how often when we find ourselves trying to explain something wonder-full do we run out of words to express it? Maybe that is why Led Zeppelin and other bands come out with such obscurities which maybe lead to shared wordlessnesses....thank you for another thought provoking blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always have a little chuckle at you articles. This one certainly brought back a few memories. When I told my husband the end bit about the lyrics he instantly knew what I was going to reply. Many moons ago when I was studying for my BA in English Lit I took a module in understanding poetry. The lecturer was very young and enthusiastic (he has since gone on to become a successful novelist); when asked how to interpret the meaning of part of a poem he replied, &quot;if you think its about a f***ing daffodil its about a f***ing daffodil. Over the years being a keen music fan I have used his wise words to interpret many band lyrics]]></description>

You are so right. How we approach little children, and take an interest in what they have to say makes a real difference

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Tim
I love School of Rock! It&#039;s totally brilliant, and Jack Black is totally over the top.
It&#039;s nice to be compared to Nick Hornby. I used to try to be like Ernest Hemingway, but I hate bullfighting, big game hunting and marlin fishing, am no good at drinking, and have no intention of topping myself with a shotgun. However I do try to keep my sentences as short as possible!
The next post gives you the chance to share your &#039;Desert Island Discs&#039;
Keep in touch
Michael]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sue
Actually I realised pretty early that assemblies need to be well planned and interactive: no questions and answers, as these can be followed up with teachers in class. The maddest ones were in Luton, including a rock band led by Music Service staff and high school students. Another involved chopping wood with an axe, though one head was outraged when I took a chunk out of her hall floor. (It was only a very small chunk...)
It&#039;s funny to be compared to Nick Hornby. I&#039;d have preferred maybe Arthur Miller, or even Doris Lessing, but Nick Hornby has earned more, and High Fidelity and About a Boy have more laughs than Death of a Salesman!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like your suggestion of asking quiet children indirect questions instead of direct questions.  This method can reduce the pressure that the quiet child feels to respond.  It might increase the likelihood that the child will speak.  I will experiment with this method in my classroom.]]></description>
