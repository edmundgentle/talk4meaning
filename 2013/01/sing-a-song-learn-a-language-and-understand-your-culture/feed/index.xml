					<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael

Great Blog: It is very interesting to read your views. I couldn&#039;t agree with you more. I lived for the first 5 years of life in India. I still have very fond memories of singing numerous songs in Hindi (nursery and older songs. Music is a big part of the Indian way of life, on the radio, in films and even in serials on TV. I remember going to cinema and can still recall and sing the songs popular at the time. Numeracy was taught through songs as well. At 5 years age I could count in Hindi up to 100. Hence when my family moved to england they throughly enjoyed watching movies such: Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music, Fiddler on a Roof and Grease. In essence my education simply continued but the foundation had been laid to speak and be fluent in more then one language.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Margaret
Do you know any Shona songs (lullabies in particular) or fun rhymes with actions? That should be a good start. Also encourage the parents to do the same!

					<description><![CDATA[I am a HUGE Steve Grocott &quot;Bright Sparks&quot; fan and always highly recommend this CD to families and practitioners on my courses. Another fabulous CD is Celtic and Caribbean fun songs by Spud and Yam I have not as yet in 14 years of teaching found any two CD&#039;s that top these smashers!! 
Steve Grocott is doing great things Linking letters and sounds with catch songs and rhymes for Early Years in Hounslow. Couldn&#039;t agree with you more Michael!

					<description><![CDATA[Great blog, Michael thank you so much for sharing and writing! 

My parents who are from St. Lucia speak a French dialect and spoke 100% English at home, because they wanted us to fit in! My parents regret this now, as they feel that we were denied a second language. Due to their views on what ‘others’ thought of their language and culture. But, mindful, this was 1960’s Britain.

Therefore, on my travels I encourage parents to speak their first language and indeed, sing, sing away on their mother tongue.

Thanks again, Michael.]]></description>
