					<description><![CDATA[Dear Micheal

As an autistic person whom had speech delay until late infancy this is certainly a fascinating read into how and connect with a young child with autism. Much of my wold (and  stills is in many ways) is sensory and interpretation of living in a world were base sensory perceptions are prominent its good to build up awareness of the world in a person centred fashion pictures and word are both fragmented to me so having someone help and assist me as young child would have benefited me greatly. :-)

Kindest regards

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Christine!
It&#039;s not so easy for teachers to allow children to follow their individual interests now, with the very prescribed curriculum. You have to wait until you go to university to get that freedom back in learning!
Best wishes from Michael]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Georgina
Yes, I take your point entirely. Some children (and adults) just prefer non-fiction. I have a friend who never reads novels. He says he gets all the fiction he needs from watching DVDs.
Best wishes
Michael]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Stella
Some children just prefer non-ficyoon books This can be a bit disappointing for parents, who want to read a bedtime STORY, but their children would prefer to share a book about trains!
Also at &#039;Storytime&#039; at nursery, some children would much prefer to hear about a book about boats. later these children may grow up to be the type of adult about whom people might say, &quot;He never reads a book for pleasure, just for facts, or he only enjoys the newspaper.&quot;
Why do I keep saying &#039;he&#039;?
Best wishes

					<description><![CDATA[Great blog post Michael which made me laugh out loud in parts. It is actually very timely as I was talking to a friend about the difficulty of finding books which interest children especially when they first learn to read. Much of what is out there, especially some of the school reading schemes are simply not that interesting, and so even once a child has read the book, it not much of a reward. I agree with you about non-fiction books as this really brings the book alive and a carefully chosen title can make a big difference.

Your blog post  has also inspired me to pick up a foreign picture book and experience the frustration of not understanding the story. Really enjoying you blog and hearing about your travels and work]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed reading your story. I was just working on children who have dyslexia and how it is not picked up in nurseries,children with dyslexia find it difficult to read or concentrate so we need to find different ways in which they can tell a story. But many a time I feel children do not enjoy books with too many words and they prefer to look at the picture. We have invested in a number of non-fiction books, even out 2 year olds like looking at the picturers and making up a story.]]></description>
