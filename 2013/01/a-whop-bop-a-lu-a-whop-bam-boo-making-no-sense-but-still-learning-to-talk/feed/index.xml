					<description><![CDATA[Great blog Michael,
I totally agree that signing is a fantastic way to learn practically anything!  Incidentially, I think I sang my way through my education - making up rhymes and ditties to help me revise and now I make up lots of nonsense songs to sing with my own children and those I work with!  I too have used Debbie&#039;s swallow a phonic game, but didn&#039;t call it that - will do from now on!  Great stuff - keep it coming!  Thank you.

					<description><![CDATA[In my opinion this is a great post! It is always valuable to help adults understand the importance of hearing and using repeated language to make the brain connections needed for verbal language. The brain is experience dependent, so a child HAS to be exposed to rich and direct language throughout the day to make the needed brain connections. (and not through TV or DVD&#039;s especially in the first two years)

I always find it interesting to think about how the brain understands a word weather it is said with a different tone of voice, whispered, spoken with an accent or sung!
Thank you for your points on the importance of singing.
This is a post I will be sharing with others.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Beverley
I must admit that a lot of my inspiration has come from visits to your setting. I know that all of your staff value their interactions with children as their main priority.
It&#039;s not easy to have conversations when there are so many children competing for attention, but it can be done!
Best wishes from Michael]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Mrs Anwar!
It was very interesting (and exciting) to hear the Head Teacher of the school where the children move to from your setting comment on how much the confidence of the children had increased. Your staff are very hard working and motivated, and I know they are all dedicated to developing children&#039;s language.
As someone has recently commented: you can have lots of interaction in a setting, but if you share songs you have had thousands!
Best wishes
Michael]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Janet
It&#039;s great to hear from you again!
My friend Annika Hallsvik, who is a dyslexia specialist and Speech and Language Therapist, will be interested in your comment about phonics. She and her Lexion programme &#039;rebuild&#039; older children&#039;s phonological awareness very successfully. 
This reinforces the need for phonological awareness. I spent time working with older children who had had glue ear under the age of five. They all had spelling difficulties, and had got by with using the &#039;whole word approach&#039; to reading. Once we rebuilt their phonological awareness, they raced ahead.
They had been diagnose with &#039;dyslexic signs&#039; in KS2, but they were not dyslexic.
Very best wishes
Michael]]></description>
