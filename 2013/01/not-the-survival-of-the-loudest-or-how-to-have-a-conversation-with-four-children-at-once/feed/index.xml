					<description><![CDATA[It is all too easy for the quiet child to be swamped by louder, more boisterous colleagues and this kind of supportive intervention is very important for all involved. Alongside the group listening development, one to one interaction can help a quiet individual (or indeed a loud one) to have the opportunity to share their thoughts and ideas and to dveelop greater confidence in expressing themseleves calmly.

I recall activities which were very effective in addition, where the adult encouraged the child to tell their story which the adult either wrote down as they spoke, and they later illustrated if they wished, or recorded the dictated story and later transcribed it. The second technique does come with a warning: once children become more confident to share their tale it can become a mamouth task to transcribe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Totally agree, this kind of interaction avoids the quieter children being overshadowed, and yet holds the interest of all concerned as they are all getting a chance to be heard.  Great conversation skills we all need in everyday life.  Hopefully these kind of supported conversation will give quieter children a sense of inclusion and help them gain confidence and self-esteem, and help louder more confident children appreciate what others have to contribute.  I will be making an effort to do this with the children in my setting.]]></description>
