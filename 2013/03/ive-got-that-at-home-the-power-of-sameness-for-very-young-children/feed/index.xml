					<description><![CDATA[As an adult, I still believe in magic.  When I do not understand how something amazing happens, I consider it to be magical.  For an example, when my husband and I bought our computer and installed a router so that we had internet access from our dish throughout the house, I thought the router was magical (I still do). Sometimes, people will provide me with an explanation for how something happens, whether I ask for it or not.  This can spoil the &quot;magic&quot; for me.  I think that all of us would be happier if we experienced a little bit of magic in our lives.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I deliver training on Quality Transitions and suggest that the setting and school should agree on a set of familiar books and songs so when the children start their new school (or move rooms in a day nursery) they immediately recognise some familiar things. Another good idea to make children feel at home is to paint pictures in their old setting then the new one displays them so when the child walks in for the first time, there&#039;s their painting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOVE this blog! Its so true.
It explains why people buy the boxed DVD set of a whole TV series and why a concert of Beethoven&#039;s 5th always sells out more quickly than Beethoven&#039;s 1st.  Its not only people with autism who like sameness!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes this happens with songs a lot - you sing Spiderman or anything that is on  a DVD or television and children are very moved by the fact and exclaim delightedly &quot;I&#039;ve got that at home&quot; It&#039;s a powerful bridge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you again thought provoking once more. I have had some interesting thoughts around the way we present books to the children here - being very very fortunate in the numbers of books we have can actually be a disadvantage for the very young possibly. I have stripped back the selection to far less and specifically make visible those that either we have used in story time or ones we have made this term by using photos of the children around the setting in and out which has led to lots of chats and delight as they see themselves in a &#039;book&#039;. Familiarity maybe another word along the lines of &#039;same&#039;. Starting from where the child is and leading them out - education! (a leading out)
Further challenges for presenting books to children as the precious new journeys of thought they offer.
Thank you!]]></description>
