					<description><![CDATA[Hi Tim
I have the impression that schoolchildren will be studying the life and achievements of Nelson Mandela for centuries to come.
It seems to me that people are crying out for political leaders with his integrity. They must exist, and we should start voting for them!
Very best wishes, and all the best for Christmas, new year and for an exciting 2014. 
I have posts lined up featuring Jethro Tull, Flight of the Conchords, Modern Family and assorted 70s bands like Focus (the Dutch bands with the yodelling elvin folk speaking in tongues) and The Doors.
