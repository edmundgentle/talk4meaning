					<description><![CDATA[Hi Louise! Thank you for your very kind words. Would you like to write a review for my new book!!??
I think that children believe that everything they are asked to do in school has a purpose, but some boarding schools used to have the weirdest practices. Apparently the whole of Parliament is run like some boys&#039; public school. I have read that new MPs are not given any guidance about what to do, but have to find everything out by making mistakes. Presumably they will feel so humiliated that they will remember the right procedure quickly. It&#039;s a form of institutionalised bullying, where the &#039;newbies&#039; or &#039;plebs&#039; are kept down by the older boys, who in turn are bullies by their seniors.
This used to be typified in hospitals and medical schools, where students and junior doctors were taught by public humiliation. just think of the &#039;ward round&#039; and the way that consultants talk to students and juniors who may have made a mistake.

We had a neurologist who used to teach us neurology once a week down at his hospital. He would ask a question like &#039;What is the function of the corpus collosum?&#039; (Luckily he didn&#039;t ask me to spell it!) If you didn&#039;t know he would roll his eyes and sneer &#039;Next!&#039; until someone answered properly. Along the way he would mutter things like, &#039;You should have done this last year/What do you mean, &#039;you don&#039;t know&#039; etc. We all made sure we knew the answer the following week. It was really humiliating though. We settled his hash good and proper though. On the last evening before the Christmas break, I got a very large jack-in-the box, with a very loose catch. We wrapped it up in paper and left it on his table before he came into the lecture theatre. He was very pleased and asked, &#039;is this for me? You shouldn&#039;t have.&#039; I felt a bit bad, because clearly this man who was so nasty to us had a bit of a soft side (or even underbelly.. probably all those liquid lunches down in the consultants&#039; restaurant). He proceeded to unwrap the present, set the catch off in the process, out jumped Jack and our persecutor nearly had a stroke! He saw the funny side  (thank goodness), but was still pretty mean to us. 
I often wondered if he was nice to patients and their families, or just someone who had been brought up to learn by public humiliation and assumed that the best way to teach was to dish out facts in the same way that he had received them.
Very best wishes

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Eileen. I&#039;m glad you like the posts, and please feel free to pass them on. Yes you are right about us making our own way in life. I think that all children need very basic things in order to have a good foundation for the rest of their lives. Put simply, this is a regular bedtime, regular meals and being safe at home and school. All of these things come from having a secure family life, whatever form that takes. That&#039;s not so easy to provide, but is essential. All that we can ask is that parents try and do their best for their children. 
All the best and I hope you have a nice Christmas too!

					<description><![CDATA[Michael

I always enjoy your posts..there are things to think about and things to laugh at in this one, as usual, we are what we are in spite of what those in authority thought they were teaching us at the time, I hope we are not making the same mistakes today....but are we making others?  Time will tell!

Have a great Christmas]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wise words, John, wise words. I&#039;m a big fan of John Hegley, who used to write a lot of funny/bittersweet poems about his childhood, when his dad used to whack him a lot. At one of his gigs he was taking questions from the audience, and someone asked him, &#039;Are you OK about writing about when you used to get punished a lot as a child?&#039;
John&#039;s reply was, &#039;It wasn&#039;t nice at the time, but it&#039;s nice to make money from writing about it.&#039;
We all kind of laughed uncomfortably at that.
Have a nice holiday yourself and very best wishes for 2014.

					<description><![CDATA[Tough times, Michael, tough times. We are what we are sometimes because of, but all too often in spite of, our past experiences.

Enjoy your holiday and I&#039;ll look forward to more of your insightful posts in the new year.
