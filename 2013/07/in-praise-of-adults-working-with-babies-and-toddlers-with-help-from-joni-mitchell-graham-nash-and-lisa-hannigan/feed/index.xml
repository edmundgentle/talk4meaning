					<description><![CDATA[Hi Trevor
I saw the Fleetwood Mac tribute band Fleetwood Bac last night, and they played Songbird! I was looking out for the member of the band who might be &#039;tributing&#039; you! Actually I see that you are mentioned on Wikipedia in their Fleetwood Mac post.
I worked and lived in a Rudolf Steiner school between 76 and late 77 so though I was immersed in lots of high culture, I was in a popular culture desert, so missed out on Rumours.
My next blog is going to be about autism, with a helping hand from Bob Dylan!
Best wishes
Michael]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Trevor!
I would say Eva Cassidy too. She had an amazing range: rock, blues, gospel, soul, folk, pop, even torchycsongs. How did she do it? And with such an awful backing band!
Best wishes

					<description><![CDATA[Really enjoyed this blog!  Takes me back . . . 
I think my vote would have to go to Eva Cassidy, though.  She made such a great job of &quot;Songbird&quot;, a lot of people think she wrote it (including some at the Beeb!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Tim!!
Just for the record, I was only PRETENDING to be grumpy with the children! They could see the funny side of it, but I do take your point about it being sometimes an exhausting experience for parents, when just getting out of the front door is like a military operation. Adults working with babies and toddlers, and I include Childminders in this, are the backbone of our society, as they provide the crucial bonding experiences that children need from quality daycare. Unfortunately their skill and commitment often goes unrecognised. 

Re the IOW Festival 1970, the legendary &#039;organisers&#039; Ricky Farr, Ron Foulk and the rest of &#039;Fiery Creations&#039; can be seen in all their glory on You Tube. However I highly recommend the DVD Message to Love&#039;. It&#039;s all there, including the legendary Joni stage intruder moment.
Great to hear from you!

					<description><![CDATA[Your blogs are officially the highlight of my non contact day now. One day I will respond more fully about the issues than about the music. In fact this might be the week because my only comments and pre knowledge of the reasons behind Joni&#039;s pet name for Graham are pretty unprintable and would certainly lower the tone of your estimable and academic Blog.
So the workshop and the language opportunities it presented sounded great and inspirational to be honest. Anyone who has raised children of their own or been around it can empathise with the physical and mental exhaustion you descibe. Also withe the ensuing crabbiness and compassion fatigue it can engender.
Ref the previous sentence I think we should in theory, all empathise with that, as we have all been part of that dynamic once upon a time, as a child. Maybe the people who most readily &quot;forget&quot; that part of their lives are those for whom the crabbiness ouweighed the love more often than it should have.
Reference the IOW festival &quot;shambolic&quot; is definitely the word. A massive clash of agendas in one spot and not a risk assessement or high vis tabard in sight.
I seem to remember the organisers name was Gary Farr (I could be wrong) but he was the archeptypal character that music scenes throw up  after the initial buzz for something new has worn off.The kid who never made it into the band but saw a money making opportunity. The rumours around Hendrix, who seemed  solely concerned with the spiritual buzz having been through the jobbing musician thing with the Isley&#039;s etc, involve money  too. Apparently various mafia elements saw what an icon he had become and wanted a piece of the action  which led to him having to gig when all he wanted to do was sit in Electric Lady studios and create psychedelic soundscape 

got to go in full flow
