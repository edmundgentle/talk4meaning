					<description><![CDATA[As Michael implies, most children develop language without difficulty. Interaction, relationships, sensory experiences and acting on objects help most children to develop into master talkers and communicators by the age of 3!

For the 1%+ of children with an autistic spectrum condition (ASC), their language and communication development is more complex. We know that the language and communication of each child with ASC is unique. While much is written on ASC to help parents and teachers support the child, the recently published book &quot;The Reason I Jump&quot; by Naoki Higashida,a 13 year old boy with ASC, gives us access to his world and helps us understand language and behaviour that can appear nonsense and unintelligible to us on the outside.

I hope this book will help you to more fully understand the language and communication of the next child you teach with ASC.

Happy summer reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John
Thank you. Watch any baby from 10 months, or anyone on the receiving end of harsh questioning from Jeremy Paxman to see children exploring schemas to expand their minds, and adults trying to defend themselves by all the little movements we do to try and keep ourselves calm while under fire!
Best wishes
Michael
So what record and book would you take on a desert island??]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Informative, as ever, Michael. I feel the need to find a child with repetitive behaviours now, just so that I can observe and interact.
