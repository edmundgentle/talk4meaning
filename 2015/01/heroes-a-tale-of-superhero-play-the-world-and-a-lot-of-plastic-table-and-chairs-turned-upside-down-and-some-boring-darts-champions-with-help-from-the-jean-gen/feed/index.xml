	Comments on: Superheroes? A tale of ‘Superhero play’, the world (and a lot of plastic tables and chairs) turned upside down, and some ‘boring’ darts champions. With help from The Jean Genie and 50,000 drunk Australian men in fancy dress!	</title>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Michael.

As ever. eye-opening observations.

Yes people&#039;s behaviour wearing fancy dress can be bizarre. I once went to a disco dressed as the invisible man. I remember stupidly arguing with the guy at the door that I should be allowed in free because I was invisible.
I had to pay!
Yesterday a friend told me that he had attended a burial service at the crematorium. A man dressed in a gorilla suit arrived and sat down for the service. Didn&#039;t say a word to anyone and left immediately afterwards. The deceased person was in the arts.

Keep the blogs coming. Can we have more Janis Joplin videos?

Remember: Live on your back and love chimney-stacks.

Very best wishes
