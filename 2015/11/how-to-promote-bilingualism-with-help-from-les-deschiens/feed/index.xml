					<description><![CDATA[Hi Simon
I seem to remember a Chinese restaurant in a small Scottish town where the waiter would ask you at the end of your meal&#039;you fuh coff-eh?&#039;
I&#039;m in Amsterdam right now and EVERYBODY is bilingual. I asked someone today, &#039;Why does everyone learn English?&#039; 
&#039;Who in the world speaks Dutch apart from us?&#039; was the reply.
Great to hear from you!

					<description><![CDATA[Fascinating clips! Really enjoyed Les Deschienes and the German prononciation clip, although I&#039;m not so sure I agreed with everything she says (charming though she is)bearing in mind British/American regional accents. 
I have a recent example of translation confusion. In a bar in Portugal my friend ordered &#039;five sambuccas&#039; - its an Italian spirit. After a surprisingly long wait of ten minutes the barman placed five hamburgers on the bar!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael, read this with interest. Love the German clip, have used in some training sessions, it really hits home.

By the way we are holding a conference in Norfolk 22nd Jan, Stephen Krashen is attending as keynote speaker... we can put you up and possibly get you a reduced rate?? 
free board and lodging too if interested.
All the best Lisa]]></description>
