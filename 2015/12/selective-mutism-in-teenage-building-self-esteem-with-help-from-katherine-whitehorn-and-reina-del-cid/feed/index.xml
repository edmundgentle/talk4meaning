					<description><![CDATA[Well there&#039;s a lovely surprise!!!!
Great lyrics. Really powerful, but in general SM is not like that. Still, it&#039;s great that a singer can start to explore childhood and teenage &#039;internal life&#039; in such a powerful way.
Hope you are well too!!!

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Simon! I spent hours in my room as a teenager. It wasn&#039;t a happy time, but I read loads (NME and Agatha Christie mainly!) and wrote lots of letters and even short stories.
Next post will be about reality TV and the amazing &#039;UP!&#039; Series]]></description>
