					<description><![CDATA[Hi Andy! Thanks for getting in touch. I passed on your info. Hazel had a very big influence on me, and my fascination with infancy and early years began with her lectures. It&#039;s hard to put into words really, but she came to visit my language unit once, and I was just thrilled that she had chosen to come and see me at work. She was always very positive an complimentary and had such interesting things to say about children.
Best wishes

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Michael for your lovely memories.  I too remember Hazel from my time at Central (a little after you I suspect).  I kept in touch with Hazel and she kindly sent me some material.  Would you be able to pass on my details to her husband Paul?  Cheers

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Paul
I&#039;m delighted that you took the time to comment on my post. Hazel was an inspirational teacher and, as you can see, had a lasting influence on me. My book, Talking and Learning With Young Children, is dedicated to her.
Very best wishes

					<description><![CDATA[Michael,

As Hazel&#039;s husband, I got only her version of events at Central and I don&#039;t remember her telling me about the rat incident - although, given we had moved into what had been a derelict building in 1978 and were still doing it up when our first two children were born in 1980 and 1982, she might not have wanted to admit that her anxieties about the building extended beyond having nightmares about dry rot (true!) which was in the building and which we had had to eradicate.

I ought to be fair to Hazel apropos your tale of her obtaining a chair at Westminster. She moved there from Central as a senior lecturer but then obtained quite shortly afterwards the position of head of the Psychology Department, which I recall being described as Chair of the Department, a description that raised expectations that the incumbent would be a Professor. However, she was not appointed Professor until some years later.

I never knew Hazel had come across as a nervous first time lecturer to her students although I knew she was always anxious to ensure she was well prepared. The only feedback I had (why do I call it &quot;feedback&quot;? I had no expectation as the spouse of a lecturer to any information on how well or otherwise she was doing) was from Elaine, the head of the Speech Therapy Department at Central, who told me that Hazel was a natural teacher. But I know she was very fond of that first cohort at Central and I knew of your existence as the only guy in the year - and, having thought at the time you occupied an enviable position, am very sorry that you only once had it off during your time at Central! 

But thank you for your appreciation of Hazel.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Mine! Fortunately hospital care of children has moved forwards so much. You have to hope that children like Emily will get help when they are adults so that they can undo for themselves some of the harm inflicted on them by parents who have themselves got &#039;unmet needs&#039;.
Hazel Dewart was great for me because she was so &#039;human&#039; in the sense that she wanted us to look at little children as sensitive beings, as opposed to fascinating specimens to rote learn about their stages of Piagetian development. (We had that too, but Hazel made sure that it was all grounded in thinking about babies and toddlers having emotional needs first and foremost.) It&#039;s very sad that she is no longer with us, but you&#039;d hope that there are lots of developmental psychologists who are as &#039;feeling&#039; as Hazel.
Best wishes
