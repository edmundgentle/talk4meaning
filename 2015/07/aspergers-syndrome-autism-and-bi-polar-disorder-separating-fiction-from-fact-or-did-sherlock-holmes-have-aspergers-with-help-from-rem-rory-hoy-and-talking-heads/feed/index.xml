					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for commenting Adele!! For the readers, pleas can you explain &#039;FG Syndrome&#039;? I too have to keep reminding myself that &#039;Rainman&#039; was a figment of the imaginations of Dustin Hoffman and the film director. The depictions of high anxiety (e.g. when the smoke alarm went off) remind me that many people with learning disabilities appear &#039;autistic&#039; when under stress. they often are described as having &#039;autistic tendencies&#039; because they like a very tight and predictable routine and have some ritualistic behaviour. This is often because they find it difficult to cope with new situations, rather than being &#039;autistic&#039;. 
What do you think?
Looking forward to your reply!!

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting and I have to admit I was one of those people who would say &quot;definitely on the spectrum &quot; but try not to now . You mentioned The Rainman but it&#039;s now known he had F G syndrome snd not autism. 
Also I am a bit concerned about AS being taken out of DSM 5 as I already know two youngsters whose parents were told that they would have met criteria for As but not ASD so didn&#039;t get any diagnosis.this wouldn&#039;t worry me if we addressed needs but without diagnosis resources can be very limited . Will be looking forward to following you .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Paul
I see what you mean. I met a young teacher recently who told me about his brother, who as a young child was really bizarre, and the whole family were quite distressed by his behaviour. However, the (accurate) diagnosis of Asperger&#039;s has been very helpful for everyone, and especially his brother, who now understands himself. 
Also, in the UK it is essential to have an accurate diagnosis otherwise children will not get appropriate support paid for by the local education department. &#039;A diagnosis of &#039;quirky&#039; won&#039;t get you anywhere!!
It seems to me that ADHD and other issues with behaviour are much more difficult to agree on. That&#039;s why I enjoyed Garden State and Silver Linings Playbook so much, because the characters are having conversations about the nature of &#039;normal&#039;. Of course it helps if they are beautiful people like Natalie Portman, Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper!
Very best wishes to you in the U.S., from me in France!

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting!  Sometimes I think it would be nice if we could just go back to calling it &quot;quirky&quot; instead of Asperger&#039;s, because with the former of these labels our society is better able to accept the positive of it rather than focus on the negative that comes with calling it a syndrome.  We&#039;re all better off with their creativity and difference, and not just those that go so far as to be considered genius.

Anyway, good post, thanks for the comment on my post, and thanks for making me think.  (You also reminded me how good a movie Silver Linings Playbook was.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Amy, and it&#039;s lovely to hear from you again!!
Yes, I think it has been important for the youngsters themselves to feel that they can identify with a group like &#039;Aspies&#039; because it is not the same as being part of a group labelled &#039;autistic&#039; because this does not acknowledge the specific aspects of development that make people with Asperger&#039;s the way they are.
Still, whatever we call people, we have all come a very long way since I qualified in 1981 and Asperger&#039;s was first brought properly to the World&#039;s attention.
Interestingly, this has proved to be one of my most popular posts. I suspect that is reflects the huge interest in ASD, which again is a huge step forward since 1981, when autism was still mysterious and not at all understood. I think we can sometimes forget just how far we have come with inclusion too.
It&#039;s lovely to hear from you again!!

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Kathy,
I wonder about that too. Since 1981 it has always seemed to me that those children with advanced language skills, but lack of social skills were different, and at that time we often identified them as having Semantic-Pragmatic Disorder. Understanding Asperger&#039;s syndrome, as a concept and reality, really opened my eyes, and it has been so beneficial for the children themselves as they grow into adulthood to identify with this group. 
We meet so many children and teens with this type of profile that it has almost become part of &#039;the norm&#039;, (at least in the US, Canada, Scandinavia and northern Europe), which is a huge step forward since 1981.
Thanks for responding and keep up the great work!!

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael,

Great article again and thanks for the link Kathy :) 

I do wonder if taking the term &#039;Asperger&#039;s Syndrome&#039; from the DSM-5 is going to be popular. I know lots of young people who identify themselves as &#039;Aspies&#039; and do recognise the skills as well as the difficulties this brings along with it. Not sure the generic term &#039;Autism&#039; will help others understand the spectrum of differences experienced by those with it.

I hope all is well with you and you&#039;ll have a chance to enjoy the summer! :)

					<description><![CDATA[Spot on, as ever, Michael.

I do sometimes wonder if a diagnosis for Aspergers is preferred to Autistic Spectrum Condition, because of the links with the high functioning individuals. Of course it is ridiculous to say that everyone with Aspergers will be brilliant mathematicians (or whatever) any more than all blue eyed people will make good Prime Ministers.

I wasn&#039;t aware of the David Byrne link either. Great music links today!!

Did you see this news article last week? A mature, human response to the situation: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/autistic-teenager-beaten-up-by-bullies-makes-them-watch-20minute-video-about-autism-10368201.html

Thanks for a great read.

Kathy
P.S. And Benedict Cumberbatch is the BEST!]]></description>
