					<description><![CDATA[Hi Trevor!
Thanks for your comments. I wonder if you saw my post about 1000 drummers and Golden Earring in Rotterdam? There seemed to be SOME girls drumming there, but maybe they had a shorter queue for the portaloos as well.
 /2014/01/yoi-dudu-doi-dudu-doi-dudu-doi-dudu-om-bom-ba-or-how-children-develop-speech-sounds-with-help-from-focus-golden-earring-and-1000-drummers-in-rotterdam/#.VTDbB40cTmQ

Do you remember The Honeycombs and their hit &#039;Have I the right?&#039; I think they were a band that Joe Meek was involved with. Anyway, I think it was around 1963 and they were famous for having a female drummer. A few years ago I heard an interview from that time between a posh BBC reporter and the drummer. He asked her, &#039;Don&#039;t you find it very tiring playing those drums?&#039; To which she replied, in a broad Cockney accent, &#039;No mate. Why should I?&#039; You could almost hear her chewing gum as she put him in his place. Great stuff!!
The &#039;Sitzpinkler&#039; issue is an important one, and most members of families with boys will have strong views on the subject!!
Great to hear from you!

					<description><![CDATA[Loved this blog!  As the oft-called &quot;Dr Poo&quot; of Brookfields School, IOften gave the advice for young boys to sit to wee (and have extended this to include men getting up in the middle of the night - you can have a variety of nasty accidents if you are standing half-awake!)

On a lighter note, I took my daughter, a drummer of then 15 years old to watch a drum clinic by the legendary Carl Palmer. The hall was filled with 240 drummers and at the &#039;comfort break&#039; at half time, she was surprised to find the only time in her short life when she had all the ladies cubicles to herself while 239 men formed a long queue outside the gents. But that was quite a few years back so I suspect more women have taken up drumming since and more men have taken to sitting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes Rosalind, I know. It was you who first pointed out that my behaviour deteriorated immediately after drinking coffee, and for several years after that it was only Lady Grey tea for me! 
Thanks for responding and I hope you are all well.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks John! The issue of having adequate toilets for women is the litmus test of a fair society, don&#039;t you think?
Best wishes
