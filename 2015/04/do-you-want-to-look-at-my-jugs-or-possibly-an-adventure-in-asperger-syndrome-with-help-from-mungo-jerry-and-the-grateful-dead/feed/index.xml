					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Lisa!!
By all accounts it was a strange festival, with several of the &#039;heavyweight&#039; acts not really impressing the crowd. Still, it was the birthplace of Mungo Jerry, so we should be thankful for that. For a while after that there was a craze for men to have massive sideburns. Sideburns, like flares, seem to be well and truly a thing of the past.
I&#039;m reading &#039;Arthur and George&#039; by Julian Barnes, and a lot of that is set in Staffordshire (It doesn&#039;t mention the Hollywood festival though)
Great to hear from you!
