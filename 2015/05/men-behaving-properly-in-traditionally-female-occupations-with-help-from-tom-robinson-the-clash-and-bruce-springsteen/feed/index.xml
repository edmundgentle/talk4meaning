					<description><![CDATA[I was once completely harpooned at an interview for a management role when one of my fellow interviewees suggested that if I were to be appointed it would be because I was male. I didn&#039;t get the role, fortunately, nor did she.

Thinking back I think I&#039;ve probably had to leave a staff room on perhaps only 2 or 3 occasions when the conversation became a little too gritty for me. My departures were accompanied by gales of laughter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Trevor! I keep forgetting that &#039;The 70s&#039; was such a long time ago! Enjoy your Fender, but don&#039;t neglect your Gibson!
Best wishes

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael

Great blog as usual!

I did a 3-day course there too, in 1976, for SLTs to learn to use the Reynell (I thought it would be useful for psychs).  I sat in the front row (keen!) and was the only male. I asked a question at the end of the first session, then at the break, a woman lampooned me and said: &quot;Thank God I&#039;ve seen you. I was sitting at the back and when I heard someone ask that question, I thought &#039;Oh dear! What poor woman has got a voice like that! So relieved to find it was a man!&quot;

Btw, talking of &quot;The Boss&quot;, I bought a Fender Tele a few months ago to do some gigs with an original 60s band (the others are all in their 70s!). It&#039;s a Blackguard deluxe in Butterscotch Blonde - looks just like Brucie&#039;s, but there the similarity ends. 

Btw, Btw . . . sold several copies of you reading &quot;Mr Noah and the Ark&quot; at a conference recently. Still goes down well. 
Blessings
