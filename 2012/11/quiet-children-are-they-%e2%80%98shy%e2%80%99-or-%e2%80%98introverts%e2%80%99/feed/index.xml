					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Ruth. Wise words. My next blog post is going to be about children with High Sensitivity, and how we can help them through exploring their ideas and interests in-depth, which is often how they like to look at the world.
Watch this space!

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael

A great blog.  I agree that all children should be accepted for who they are and not encouraged to be something they are uncomfortable with.  Young children have only lived for such a short time.  As an adult I feel my role is to celebrate every child for their uniqueness, and hopefully help them value and be content with themselves.

Kind regards

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John
Thanks for these comments.
You are so right! What do you think we can do to support these children: in an everyday practical way and at a national level?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a great introductory subject for your new blog, Michael. I quite agree and have long despaired at the negative connotations that have been attached to introverted children, not least within Early Learning Goals. Introverts are perhaps more cautious in nature, have a greater facility for self-reflection and a tendency to study a social situation before contributing. These are not negative traits; just a different way of being and behaving.]]></description>
