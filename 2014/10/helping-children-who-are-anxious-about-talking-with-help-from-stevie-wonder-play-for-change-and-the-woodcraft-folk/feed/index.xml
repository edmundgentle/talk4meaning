					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for getting in touch Eilis!
I think as we get older we are more aware about taking risks (at least physically!)
&#039;Dread&#039; is a very good word to use, but with sensitive support (and not putting children on the spot because we believe that &#039;you need to be cruel to be kind&#039;, shy children can make a lot of progress.
There are loads of other posts, and I hope you have time to dip in to some of them!
Best wishes from Michael]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this article and I myself  hated reading out loud in front of the class when younger and it reminds me of the dread before it was my turn. I work with young children and always aware of letting them have time to talk in their own time without pressurizing them. Funny though cause when you were talking about the climbing trees as a young child it brought back memories of how I loved to do same and not so great now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Mary
Thank you for responding. Bewildering is the word! The SMIRA DVD helps us to see this extreme anxiety from the child&#039;s point of view. 
If you have ever had massive anxiety before giving a talk, then you can start to empathise.
Please email if you&#039;d like to discuss the subject further, or visit www.talk4meaning.co.uk
Best wishes
Michael]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for replying Maggie!
Everyone has fears, and sometimes terrors, that just don&#039;t bother other people at all. It&#039;s helpful to remind adults sometimes of that.
It&#039;s only when I&#039;m on a rollercoaster or some mad ride at a theme park that I realise just how much I hate being up high. By then it&#039;s too late!!]]></description>
