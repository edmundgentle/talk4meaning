					<description><![CDATA[Hi John
Nice to hear from you.
I know exactly what you mean. I&#039;ve just spent an hour with a six year old who just totally &#039;gets&#039; counting on from 4 to 20 to get 16, in his head. He found me trying to help him really annoying!
The human mind, in all its variations, is absolutely miraculous!!

					<description><![CDATA[I find the symbolizing of numbers completely astonishing. I spent truly ages trying to find a child-friendly way to find an illustration of number representation (e.g. oo=2 and ooo=3, etc.) that would synthesise with the concept of place value before reaching the conclusion that I was incapable of the feat. Whilst I&#039;m convinced that we are genetically programmed with the ability to perform maths I&#039;m in awe of how children manage to move to abstract concepts so quickly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Usha
Thank you for replying. I suppose that teaching numbers and calculation are the easiest things for us to do, but there are so many other things to talk about! I find that children enjoy learning about and talking about money and shopping (as much as adults do!), so this is a good vehicle for all sorts of maths talk.
Best wishes

					<description><![CDATA[HI Michael

Enjoyed reading this article.True, maths is all around us yet, we distance children from this by our own mistake of introducing numbers in a very abstract manner.
