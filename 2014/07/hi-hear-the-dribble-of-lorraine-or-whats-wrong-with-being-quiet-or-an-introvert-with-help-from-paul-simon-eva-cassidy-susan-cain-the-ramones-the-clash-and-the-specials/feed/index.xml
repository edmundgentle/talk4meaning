					<description><![CDATA[Hi John
It&#039;s good to have these fearful experiences, because it helps us to empathise with others and to realise that an &#039;irrational&#039; fear can be gradually got rid of, but &#039;gradual&#039; is the key word.

					<description><![CDATA[I agree. Years ago I attended a staff training event with the whole school. Some of the midday supervisors were asked to give a short presentation and one lady in particular was mortified that she was being asked to speak in front of others.

I&#039;ve also seen a very successful business man, used to giving keynote speeches at large conferences, have a near nervous breakdown when asked to talk to a school of children!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow John!
That has really got me thinking. What you say about the social environments and habits certainly makes me think about people who lack confidence in social skills and become very anxious about the impression they made/might make through talking.
I&#039;m sure this is a very strong force for teens, and girls in particular, where how we talk on groups if teens is judged to be very important.
Sometimes it&#039;s only in adulthood that we can get to a point where we are comfortable about who we are socially and don&#039;t worry so much about what other people think. 
Thanks for that!

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps &quot;Idiosyncratic&quot; or &quot;oblique&quot;. Paul Simon penned my favourite lyric of all time - &#039;I&#039;m gonna stand guard like a postcard of a Golden Retriever&#039;. Brilliant stuff.

Art Garfunkel: I have to agree, he&#039;s always struck me as perhaps a bit creepy! 

I read your post after I&#039;d been chatting to my colleagues in the sunshine. I was slightly gregarious and, though I say it myself, whilst my wit may not have been sparkling it was gently effervescent. It occurred to me that I was contriving my personality to suit the social context. Writing poetry the following day I was isolated, moody and  most definitely not witty. I suspect that personality traits are habit forming and we all need access to a variety of social environments to remain healthy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John
Yes, I agree with you on both counts. I suspect that I&#039;m not exactly sure what &#039;mawkish&#039; actually means!(I trawled through my collection of NMEs from the last 40 years and found a review of &#039;There Goes Rhyming Simon&#039; that used that word. ( only joking about that last point!)
You have hit the nail on the head about when certain traits in our nature can get in the way of how we operate in groups. It&#039;s good to be able to accurately label how you are, and then try and accommodate to the needs of groups: e.g in meetings or in class.
Also, as a pupil/student, it&#039;s helpful if the teacher explains how they would like the class to behave viz a viz contributing verbally (&#039;hands up before you ask a question/wait until I have finished talking and then we can have a discussion&#039;etc.) in my day this would have helped me from getting whacked!!!
Great to hear from you. If you supply me with an alternative to &#039;mawkish&#039; then I will be happy to change it. And what do you think about me describing Art Garfunkel as a bit creepy?
Great to hear from you
Michael
