Also there is a reference to the smell of nail varnish in &#039;American Hustle&#039;. I had no idea what that film was about but couldn&#039;t take my eyes off the brilliant actors!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Tim
As usual, you have hit the nail square on the head!
Teens often complain of their teachers&#039; &#039;coffee and cigarette breath&#039;. We can&#039;t avoid eating and drinking, but good oral hygiene is a must for anyone getting up close and personal to children. Maybe this issue could be dealt with in the same way that we deal with the staff &#039;dress code&#039;, being punctual for the lessons you are teaching, and how we talk to pupils? (Actually these are often NOT addressed explicitly in any school policy document, and can lead to significant aggravation- among staff and pupils.)
Great to hear from you.
My next post is about T Rex, George Harrison and led Zep. Can you see a link? (Clue: &#039;My Sweet Lord&#039;, &#039;Whole Lotta Love&#039; and &#039;We love to boogie&#039;

					<description><![CDATA[Recently attended some INSET delivered by one of our midday meals supervisors who has autism and can describe to us what his autism is like first hand. More importantly all the sensory issues his autism gave him to deal with through his often difficult school career. IE what HIS autism felt smelt sounded and looked like.
One of his teacher&#039;s breath smelt so bad to him that he would get up and run away. Point being working with people with potentially hypersensitive sensory input issues,get the basics right. Make sure your very physical presence isn&#039;t an affront.
