					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Eileen!
I have been looking closely at the needs of twins and their families.
Large buckets of common sense, sensitivity and energy are needed to survive the first three years and then go on to support the children into strong identities as individuals and siblings. In the meantime they have to endure the minefield of other people&#039;s misconceptions.
Thanks for replying!

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Micheal
I shall remember the masking tape trick and pass it on...Lynyrd Skynyrd, all that hair and cheesecloth shirts, where have the years gone!
A &quot;set of twins&quot; I once cared for were identical the Mother sensibly cut the hair short for the little one with the short name, and allowed his sibling with the longer name to have longer hair, we could call each by their own name even from the back!  This enabled each to have their own identity and made us feel so much better as we always got their names right...simple...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Mary
I wonder why you have a policy to split twins up? 
The link below is from 2001, but the issues are still as live today as they were then. There are many more twins being born, and for me the issue of their welfare is very important.

This is an important subject, even though I set it within a very flippant blog post!
Best wishes

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Karen
Aeroplanes are such strange places, aren&#039;t they. And airports are strange too! 
Thank you for taking the time to read my posts

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Michael - I guess the airport security will just have to get used to rolls of tape - a cheaper option to the see-through plasters we travelled with when our children were under-10&#039;s.

I&#039;m interested in the split/not split debate - our school policy is to split twins, so they are in separate classes. Of course they can be together for most of the day during freflow if they so choose, but different classes allows individuals to develop and has been successful over the years - any direction to helpful research would be appreciated. Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Michael, this is absolutely hilarious, I&#039;ve been giggling out loud. Still am. 
Our little ones are not twins but they are the same size and look alike. We collectively call them &#039;the babies&#039; - it doesn&#039;t seem to have hurt them as they go about finding their own identities. 
I&#039;m definitely bringing a few rolls of masking tape on our upcoming flight! Many thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My six year old loves nothing more than a roll of masking tape and a cardboard box to create things with, she then unsticks and remakes them into something else and has enjoyed this since she first got her hands on masking tape at around 3 years old. I wish I&#039;d known this several years ago on a flight with my 11 year old son who was then aged 18 months, suffering from ear ache and miserable!]]></description>
