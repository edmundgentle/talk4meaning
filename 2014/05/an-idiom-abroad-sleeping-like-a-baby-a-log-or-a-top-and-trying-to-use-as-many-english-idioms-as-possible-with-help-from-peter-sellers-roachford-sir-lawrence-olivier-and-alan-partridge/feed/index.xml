					<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael, I didn&#039;t realise how some of my everyday language gets picked up by my reception children! I told a child that they were &#039;on a roll!&#039; He replied &#039;do you mean a sausage roll?&#039; That put a smile on my face!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Elly!
Which words do the  youngsters that you teach use? Social media is their world now, I guess. 
We were discussing who might be classed as an &#039;extrovert&#039; and a good definition is &#039; a person who gets their energy from other people.&#039; One of the delegates wondered if you could apply this to someone who does a lot of social networking via the Internet. It&#039;s an interesting thought!

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael, you really made me laugh. I hadn&#039;t heard the one about the carrot (the Dutch one) but here is a really silly one from the Netherlands. In Dutch it is: Ik heb er een broertje aan dood. Translated into English: I have a little brother dead to it. Meaning: I really hate doing this. My mother knew loads of idioms. My Welsh dictionary has a whole section devoted to Welsh idioms. I think they&#039;re great. On the subject of sarcasm, I have noticed that my pupils use this word, and the word ironic, to a far greater extent in the last couple of years. Is this thanks to social media? Elly]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Felicity!
Could those be the most obscure, yet truly fascinating set of idioms in English?!
All languages have idioms, and we should use them. That&#039;s an interesting point you make about children&#039;s understanding of sarcasm and idioms. I guess it&#039;s something to do with the growing awareness that words can have many meanings. Sarcasm is often portrayed by tone of voice and facial expression, ( i.e. a purposeful mismatch between the two.) so children must need quite a complex grasp of communication to understand that you can say one thing, but mean the other.
Many thanks for your comment
Best wishes

					<description><![CDATA[My mother&#039;s favourite for dirty children was &quot;Black as the devil&#039;s nutting bag&quot; - understood I think by mining communities and when astounded would always say &quot;I&#039;ll go to the foot of our stairs!&quot; and when things could not be found they were &quot;up in Annie&#039;s room behind the clock&quot;
I think that it is really intersting that children&#039;s understanding of idioms develops almost alongside their understanding of sarcasm - adults really make English complicated, but what a poorer, less rich language we would have without those complications!]]></description>
