					<description><![CDATA[Hi Patricia! I&#039;m glad you like the posts. I had to think twice about what you meant about men&#039;s &#039;buns&#039;!
I think Bill Bailey is just great, and I&#039;m working on a post that will somehow justify me including him playing &#039;Duelling Sitars&#039; with an Indian Bhangra band.
I&#039;m hoping that this will float your boat, but if you can&#039;t wait then you can always Google it to check out some amazing playing.
Best wishes

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Michael,
I always look forward to seeing that another of your entertaining posts has arrived in my in-box. For one thing, you are widening my musical experience, if not, it would appear, my tastes. One either responds positively to male Neapolitans with inexplicable Greek goddess buns, or one does not. But,the Bill Bailey Kraftwerk tribute; up there with those people playing &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; extremely meaningfully on massed mandolins. I wonder if you&#039;ve seen it?
Well, that&#039;s me away.
