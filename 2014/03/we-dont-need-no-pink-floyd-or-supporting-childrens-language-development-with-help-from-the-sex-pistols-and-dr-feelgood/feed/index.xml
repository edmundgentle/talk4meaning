					<description><![CDATA[I did check your other website but seem strangely drawn back to this one. Probably because I feel duty bound to at least attempt to conclude with something &quot;educational&quot;
Have been busy with the Curst Sons. Also went to a fantastic day event in Brighton. The Creative Minds  conference run and managed by learning disabled artists. Massive debates and big questions. Check out their talking area on the creative minds website.
Re: the pistols have you seen the movie of their 2005(?) reunion gigs at Brixton academy.... Awesome

					<description><![CDATA[Loving the Ummagumma pastiche photo. The only &quot;Floyd&quot; album I ever bought was Saucerful of Secrets. No cover, 10 bob in wh smiths bargain bucket.If you really want to dislike &quot;The Floyd&quot; watch live in Pompei...Them in a restaurant eating an apple pie and moaning about not having a corner piece. ...It&#039;s like we all needed punk but didn&#039;t know why til it came.

Anyway have you noticed this thing people do when they are fans of a band and shorten the name. Once I&#039;ve got over the irritation (especially if it&#039;s a band  I irrationally and subjectively dislike) I get to wondering why. My theory, for what it&#039;s worth, is it&#039;s to do with a sort of claimed intimacy. After all only people close to you are allowed to shorten your name.Isn&#039;t that the rule? If I started calling you Mike there would be a very English frisson of awkwardness. But there may be people in your life that know you as Mike, or even Mikey.
So if you like the psychedelic furs etc you call them &quot;The Furs&quot; or &quot;The manics&quot; or the &quot;Pistols&quot; It even  extends to band members names &quot;Richey&quot; and &quot;Johnny.&quot; Best to head it off at the pass and shorten it yourself...., The Clash (you can&#039;t shorten) Madonna, Prince etc although there&#039;s been some messing with their names along the nickname route which  may be slightly different I think.

For reasons I can&#039;t fathom half my class are calling me a 57 year old man, Timmy Boy at the moment. Also there seem to be more people in my life calling me Timmy. I don&#039;t really mind. However I did work with someone once who called me by my surname, or called me &quot;boy&quot; which caused me to ask /tell him not to.I think he went to public school but I didn&#039;t.
 I instinctively  feel uncomfortable  when I hear teachers/ carers calling children by their first and second name together.In  British culture I think it  probably signifies something demeaning. I may well be  wrong but in my experience it&#039;s usually the precursor to a telling off. What&#039;s in a name? A lot.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Patricia!
Funny you should say that, because my next post is about how I nearly ran away from home to be a roadie with Hawkwind, and  on another occasion had the good fortune to bump into Phil Collins at a festival and got to ask him a very important question!
That&#039;s not as unlikely as it sounds, as I was brought up near Guildford, and in the 70s the surrounding area was literally awash with rock stars!
More soon!
Michael (in an exclamation mark kinda mood)]]></description>
