					<description><![CDATA[Michael,

In the U.S., teachers avoid saying &quot;no&quot; to young children.  In fact, many parents specifically ask teachers not to say &quot;no&quot; to their children.  So, we began saying &quot;no,thank you&quot; because it seemed a more polite and gentler way to communicate with young children.  In my experience, the command worked briefly; however, the child usually repeated the behavior later in the day.  At a training I attended recently, the presenter explained to us that a young child will interpret &quot;no, thank you&quot; as meaning &quot;It&#039;s okay to do it, just not right now.&quot;  What a revelation!  I am trying to remove that phrase from my classroom vocabulary.

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Elly
I know I am most aware of what words I use when I am tutoring children individually , and explaining things like maths ideas. I have a tendency to say, &#039;yeh?&#039; a lot. Sometimes it means &#039;do you understand&#039; and sometimes it means nothing! This can be confusing. Secondary teachers do this a lot when explaining things, but rather than use it as a way of pausing to check that everyone has understood, they just go marching on!
I&#039;m not trying to make people paranoid, but it&#039;s good to listen to ourselves sometimes when students/children are not understanding. people with Asperger&#039;s get really confused by all the extra bits we add in to our language.
Best wishes
Michael 
Hope you don&#039;t give yourself too many bruises!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael

That was so brilliant. I shall be noticing every word I say this week and kick myself under the desk when I hear myself saying the &#039;wrong&#039; thing. I wonder how bruised my leg will be at the end of the week.
