					<description><![CDATA[Thanks John!
The two day course went very well, I&#039;m pleased to say. People who come on my courses about understanding and supporting quiet children are often very quiet and reflective themselves, and we often discuss children&#039;s emotional lives in depth. By the end of the  two days I was completely exhausted and high on caffeine, but I became hooked on Thai massages and paid for various types. The one I enjoyed the most was similar to &#039;aromatherapy&#039; that I had experienced in the UK quite a few years ago.
I went on to spend two weeks with my wife in Cambodia. What an extraordinary country: ruined temples, traffic, lovely people and everywhere adults with limbs missing due to landmines. The country is still recovering from the four years when the Khmers Rouges were in power. My next two posts will be about that, so probably a bit more serious than usual.
Thanks for your comments!!
