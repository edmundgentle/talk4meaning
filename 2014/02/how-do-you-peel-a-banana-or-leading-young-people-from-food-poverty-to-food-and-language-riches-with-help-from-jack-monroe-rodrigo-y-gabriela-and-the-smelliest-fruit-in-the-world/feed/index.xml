					<description><![CDATA[Hi Debbie
Thank you for your kind words.
I agree about the Jack Monroe clip. It makes me feel like I have just had a bowl of Thai noodle soup with too much chilli sauce in it! 
I think there is a lot of mileage in setting up cooking workshops for parents, and particularly those on a low income, who may be &#039;vulnerable&#039; in all sorts of ways. They could have a big impact on language development. Guess who I think would be just the right person to do this? I have read several articles about Jack, and in one she mentions that lentils are very cheap and nutritious, but we have to realise that not everyone likes lentils (including me!) I think the concept of taking &#039;value range&#039; food and creating meals that little children would love to eat is just brilliant. 
BTW Waitrose have brought out a &#039;basics&#039; range. I don&#039;t know what the price range is, but I know that you can go there 20 minutes before closing time and get amazing bread that normally retails for £1.99 for 20p. I used to live near Waitrose in North Finchley and used to buy loads of it and freeze it!
Thank you for responding and feel free to email my post to anyone you know who has little children or works with families.
Bye for now

					<description><![CDATA[As always your post are so readable/funny/enlightening in their messages re language development. But it was  the girl called Jack VT that really touched me. I have two little boys who are always hungry, not in sense that Jack describes but rather just because they are two growing boys. Helped me to get some perspective. THANK YOU]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John
That is quite fascinating and almost like the sort of dialogue that you might see on comedy shows like The Fast Show, or being developed by Harry Enfield or Steve Coogan, or even a character in a new version of The Vicar of Dibley (shades of &#039;No, no, no, no.... yes!&#039;)
You have given me an idea....
Best wishes

					<description><![CDATA[It made all twums on me twaaziz - I had to say it out loud to get it! Fantastic!

The first sentence gave me fond memories too. I taught a child who ended every sentence in this manner: he gave to me... he did; it were &#039;orrible... it was; I can do it... I can. His grandmother had exactly the same speech pattern but he managed to leave an extended pause before the rejoinder. I used to wait for him to finish a sentence and  we&#039;d stare at each other for several seconds; he&#039;d start to fidget, I&#039;d sigh and then, together, we&#039;d complete his phrase. It was all very odd.....................
