					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Tim!!!
An amp that goes up to 12?&#039;why not buy a bigger amp?&#039; &#039;&#039;Because this one goes up to 12&#039;
Does that make you the David St Hubbins of your band? 
Great to hear from  you!

					<description><![CDATA[Yes indeed. I&#039;ve come in for quite a bit of stick about encouraging children to move to &#039;rock and pop&#039; when really we should be &#039;inculcating&#039; a love of &#039;classical&#039; music. Hmmm... how to respond? I know that staff in Steiner schools have been using this approach since the schools were founded. However... (minefield approaching!!)
Didn&#039;t Coleridge and friends enjoy the odd puff of laudanum? After you have visited the local &#039;Kubla Khan Coleridge Experience Tea Rooms&#039; you may be whistling &#039;Xanadu&#039; by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; Titch (try moving to that!!!!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Write Dance sounds well worth trying. I saw the value of movement and music and language learning with &#039;Take 10&#039;video materials designed to help children learn foreign languages. 

Going on a walk starting at Coleridge&#039;s cottage in Nether Stowey, Somerset on Sunday. Will be whistling &#039;Albatross&#039;   along the way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sue
I should point out that the Write Dance programme is a brilliant idea, and I highly recommend that teachers invest in it. The point I&#039;m making in the post is that some adults and children don&#039;t instantly &#039;get into&#039; the music or language, while others do, so they should consider adapting it to suit the children they are working with.

You can find out more by visiting writedancetraining.com
Thanks for your kind comments! Keep smiling, man.

					<description><![CDATA[&#039;This amp is specially designed to be extra loud, so it can be turned up to 11&#039;
&#039;Why not just buy a bigger amp?&#039;
&#039;Because this one goes up to 11&#039; it&#039;s logical....
Seriously Mine, please read my reply to Sue Thomas about the value of Write Dance. It&#039;s a great scheme, but like any approach in education, teachers should feel free to adapt a resource to meet the needs of the children they are working with.]]></description>
