					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Michael.

On one occasion I took a child too seriously when he came up to me looking quite distressed in class.
I said, &#039;What&#039;s the problem?&#039;
He said, &#039;It&#039;s my cartilage.&#039;
Showing a  lot of concern, I said, &#039;Sit down, you must rest it.&#039;
He looked puzzled but not as much as I looked when he lifted up his ink stained hands.
&#039;It broke,&#039; he said &#039;and went all over my hands.&#039;

Great Talking Heads video - probably the best band I ever saw in concert.

Take care.]]></description>
